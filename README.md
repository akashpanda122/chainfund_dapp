# ChainFund

# Inspiration
- We believe that when individuals, charities, government and companies work together, millions of people can benefit.

- One day we met a man, who had been out of work longer than he could remember.

- As the months passed, we became determined to find ways to help the man leave homelessness for good. But he knew he couldn’t do that on his own. That’s when we had the idea to crowdfund for homeless people.

- Through the power of people and technology, we transform how the world supports those left behind.

- At Chainfund crowdfunding dapp we understand the importance of fostering meaningful connections and providing a safe and secure platform for users.

- Let's come together and make a positive impact on homelessness by building a supportive community through our dapp.

## What it does
- Our homeless crowdfunding dapp, helps reduce homelessness by supporting people in finding jobs and homes that lift them out of homelessness for good.

- Help a person get a stable career or home by funding their campaign.
  
- Dozens of employers, from startups to household can use Chainfund to hire diverse talent. 

- Our dapp's primary goal is to provide a safe and secure platform where people can connect and come together to make a positive impact on homelessness.


## How we built it
- Traditional crowdfunding platforms are often centralized and charge high fees.

- Our decentralized crowdfunding platform uses Polygon blockchain to help the homeless. We are using cutting-edge technology to make charitable donations more efficient and transparent than ever before.

- By utilizing the Polygon network, we are able to minimize transaction fees and ensure that donations go directly towards providing vocational training for the homeless.
